Welcome to your agentic RAG system knowledge base.

This is the first document. The system is designed to be modular, with different agents handling different tasks.
The Retriever agent is responsible for fetching relevant information from this knowledge base.
The Generator agent then uses this information to construct an answer.

Let's add some specific facts.
The capital of France is Paris.
The 2024 Summer Olympics were held in Paris.
The currency of Japan is the Yen.
The highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest.

This system uses LangChain for its core components and LangGraph for orchestrating the agents.
ChromaDB is used as the vector store for efficient similarity searches.
The entire application is containerized using Docker for portability.
